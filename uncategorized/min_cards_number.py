# You are playing a cards game whee each card has a number representing how much points is worth. 
# The goal of the cards game is to find the smallest number of cards that sum up o a specific 
# amount of poins. 
# If the total can not be summed up to with any combination of cards, return -1 
# Assume you can use as many of he same cards as many time as you want. 
#example 1 
# cards = [1,2,5]
# total = 11 
# output = 3 
# explanation = 11 = 5+5+1 

#example 2
# cards = [1,3,5]
# total = 12
# output = 3 
# explanation = 12 = 4 +4 +4 

#example 3 
# cards = [2]
# total = 3
# output = -1

#example 4
# cards = [1]
# total = 0
# output = 0
